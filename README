As of rspec-rails-1.2.7, spec_server is deprecated in favor of the spork gem:

http://github.com/timcharper/spork

For those of you working on Windows (no spork for windows just yet), or those
who may otherwise prefer spec_server over spork (really????), here is the
spec_server from rspec-rails-1.2.7, merged into a single file. Just grab this
file, stick it in the scripts/ folder, and you're good to go.

I'm putting this up here so you can have it, but I have no intention of
maintaining it. Anyone who wishes to is welcome to fork this repo and take
this over.

Cheers,
David
